## Credits
• Thanks to Herpa for suggesting this tweak and giving me more ideas for improvements, and suggesting this icon. My icon idea was NT in red over a semi-transparent white...

• Thanks to whoever made the tea emoji and no-access emoji cause my icon is basically the two of them on top of each other
